Error Categories:
1) Fabricated claim: Introduction of a claim not present in the reference.
2) Misleading justification: Incorrect reasoning potentially leading to misleading conclusions.
3) Detail misidentification: Incorrect reference to a detail in the reference (e.g., body part, finding).
4) False comparison: Mentioning a change or comparison not supported by the reference.
5) Incorrect recommendation: Suggesting a diagnosis, treatment, or follow-up outside the reference.
6) Missing claim: Failure to mention a claim present in the reference.
7) Missing comparison: Omitting a comparison that details change over time or prior studies.
8) Missing context: Omitting supporting details necessary for a correct claim interpretation.
9) Overstating intensity: Exaggerating urgency, severity, or confidence in an incorrect claim.
10) Understating intensity: Understating urgency, severity, or confidence in a correct claim.
11) Other: Additional errors not covered in the defined categories.
