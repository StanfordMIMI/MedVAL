Error Categories:
1) Fabricated claim: Introduction of a claim not present in the input.
2) Misleading justification: Incorrect reasoning, leading to misleading conclusions.
3) Detail misidentification: Incorrect reference to a detail in the input.
4) False comparison: Mentioning a comparison not supported by the input.
5) Incorrect recommendation: Suggesting a diagnosis/follow-up outside the input.
6) Missing claim: Failure to mention a claim present in the input.
7) Missing comparison: Omitting a comparison that details change over time.
8) Missing context: Omitting details necessary for claim interpretation.
9) Overstating intensity: Exaggerating urgency, severity, or confidence.
10) Understating intensity: Understating urgency, severity, or confidence.
11) Other: Additional errors not covered.
